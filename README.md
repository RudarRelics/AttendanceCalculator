The Attendance predictor Project is a tool designed to assist users in predicting their attendance percentage based on their maximum hours, attended hours, and planned absences. This tool is invaluable for students striving to monitor their attendance and meet 75% attendance, which are frequently mandated by educational institutions.

One significant feature of this project is its ability to calculate the hours necessary to achieve a minimum attendance threshold in cases where the predicted attendance falls below 75%. This function serves as a proactive measure, allowing users to strategize and allocate additional time to attend events or classes as needed. By providing this information, the Attendance Prediction Project empowers users to take actionable steps towards meeting their attendance goals and maintaining compliance with institutional requirements.

If you're a student striving to fulfill course attendance requirements, the Attendance Prediction Project equips you with the insights.
